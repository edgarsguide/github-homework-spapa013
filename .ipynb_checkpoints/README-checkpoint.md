# Practicing Git
Welcome! Here is a few simple exercise to verify that you got your Git and GitHub routine figured out!

1. Clone this repository to your local computer. Hint: Use `git clone "address of repository"`. Be sure to replace the address of repository with this repository's address!
2. Add a new Python file into the repository. Call it `hello.py`.
3. Inside `hello.py`, write code that prints out a greeting message. For bonus, make your code ask for a name, and printout a nicely personalized greeting.
4. **Add** and **commit** your new file in the repository. Hint: `git add filename` and `git commit -m "commit message"`
5. **Push** you new commit to GitHub repository - this is how you **submit** your homework assignment! Hint: `git push`
6. Go back to your Python code and make some changes. After that **add** and **commit** again. 
7. Repeat step 6 as many times as you feel like.
8. **Push** all of your commits!
9. You are done!
